The results show a 93.2% correlation between 
"Sales" and "Dollar Volume". By checking the data, we found that "Dollar Volume" is equal to "Sales" 
multiplied by "Average Price". To avoid collinearity, "Dollar Volume" is removed. After all these steps, 
we examined the correlation and distribution of our new data set through plots made by Seaborn and 
Matplotlib library.

A histogram is used to check the shape of a distribution, determining whether it is symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right. It also helps to identify the presence of a bimodal or multimodal distribution and to detect outliers.
