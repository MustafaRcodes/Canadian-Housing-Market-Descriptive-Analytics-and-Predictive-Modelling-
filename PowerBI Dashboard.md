My analytical procedure, including data merging with Python, data cleaning, Feature engineering, data visualization using Power BI, and predictive modeling. I start by analyzing pricing trends and market conditions, especially post-COVID-19. Next, I evaluate housing market supply and demand using four key indicators and predictive modelling.

Insights: Overall, my results are indicative of a natural life cycle in the real-estate market. 
Overvaluation in the housing market has already been identified (2021), where houses were overvalued compared to income levels & affordability. This was followed by a slowdown in price growth (2022) due to the buyer becoming cautious & aware of the overheating of the market. The demand softened while the sellers perhaps rushed to list properties at the first signs of price growth slowing down.The year 2023 signifies market correction where prices will be pushed down and adjust till supply & demand strike a new balance.

Insights: Although the fluctuations in housing sales volume vary across different cities, they all maintain a consistent trend. 
From 2012 to 2023, sales in the GTA Area has experienced two peak periods, occurring in 2016 and 2021, respectively. 
Since the Canadian central bank began raising interest rates in March 2022, housing sales volume in various regions of GTA have shown a decline with the prices decline accordingly.

Insights: Overall, housing prices in Toronto are significantly higher than in other regions for all home types. Durham has the lowest average prices for all home types. 
Average price CAGR from 2012 to 2023 appears to be the similar across all types of buildings (ranging from 7.2% to 8.2%). This gives a few useful insights into the market segments.
Demand/Supply balance has been maintained in the same proportion across all segments in the housing market.
The prices in the housing market is primarily governed by the broader economic factors and relates weakly to differences in preferences for various types of housing.
For an investor, this may also mean that the increase in the value of the asset is not governed by the type of house the investor invests in.
